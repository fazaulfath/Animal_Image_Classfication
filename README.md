# Animal Classification Project

## Objective
Build a deep learning model to classify 15 different animals using CNNs.

## Dataset
The dataset contains 15 classes of animal images (e.g., Cat, Dog, Lion).

## Approach
1. Preprocessed images to 224x224 pixels.
2. Trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with TensorFlow/Keras.
3. Evaluated using validation data and confusion matrix.

## Results
Achieved a validation accuracy of X%.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sakthivel-ml/animal-classification.git
   ```
